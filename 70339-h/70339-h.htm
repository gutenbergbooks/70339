</div>

<p>The purpose of this book is to give information concerning the
methods by which upholstery work may be successfully carried
on in school shops. The added beauty and comfort given to
furniture by upholstery makes work of this character worth while.
If period furniture is to be reproduced or modified, the worker
must understand the art of upholstering.</p>

<p>The tendency to reproduce or copy good old pieces of furniture
should be encouraged, for only in this way may a student obtain
a proper background, from which may be developed a new style.
New ideas, derived from the best of the old, are likely to serve
humanity in the best way.</p>

<p>The study of the art of upholstery is an interesting one. It
leads into many avenues of interest and profit, such as the history
and methods of weaving; the processes of tanning and coloring; the
manufacture and history of textiles; and the like. Such correlation
is valuable, and each is distinctly educational.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Prof. Chas. A.
Bennett for valuable suggestions and inspiration; to David H.
Tingwall for valuable help, and photographs; to A. C. Newell
for suggestions on the outlines; to Wm. F. Tuttle for the photographs
of antiquarian furniture taken at the Art Institute of
Chicago; to Bessie Bennett for certain information about the
furniture; to John R. Fasier for the drawing in Fig. <a href="#image034">28</a>; and to my
former and present Bradley students for inspiration and help.</p>

<p>The practical contents have been verified and corroborated by
Henry Euler, a practical upholsterer for fifty-nine years, and by
Herman Schwartling who has followed the trade for thirty years.</p>

<p>Upholstering in its broadest sense means the furnishing of a
house with draperies, curtains and other hangings; bedding; coverings
for couches, chairs and stools; and coverings for carriages and
automobiles.</p>

<p>The word upholster, or upholsterer, designates the workman who
hangs the draperies and attaches textiles or leather to furniture.
In the early days of the craft, as well as today, draperies had to
be hung in a manner that assured retention of their shape, and
textiles required stuffing and springs underneath to give the fabric
permanent form. This holding up attribute led to the use of the
words “upholder,” “upholster,” “upholstering,” and “upholsterer.”
These applied also to furniture huxters who held up their
wares for inspection when sold at auction.</p>

<p>“The old time castle or baronial hall, with its strong stone walls
and stone floors, was, so far as comfort went, little better than the
clay hut of the feudal serf; but when the ladies of the baronial
family had excogitated, or acquired the art of needlecraft, and had
become proficient therein, the “up-holder” sprang into being, as a
necessary adjunct to an important family. The ladies’ needlework
(tapestry) was obviously adapted to drape the rude stone walls
of the feudal hall, and the artisan who could drape or hang it
effectively and without injury was a useful dependent, or tradesman,
who, as he caused the tapestry to “hold up,” naturally became
known as an “up-holder,” or “upholsterer.”</p>

<p>“The Egyptians from the earliest times used upholstered
couches, chairs, and footstools,” says Richard Bitmead. “It is
known, too, that their neighbors, the Assyrians, excelled in weaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
and practiced the art of decorating draperies by the introduction
of gold in the woof. The rich carpets of Persia and the muslins of
India were in use for ages before the Romans set foot in Britain,
and there can be little doubt but that the Oriental people raised
the art to a very high standard, and long before the trade was
known in Europe. But at the present time, much more so than
formerly, the progress of the arts, the refinements of taste, the
caprice of fashion, and the habits and requirements of luxurious
ease, which have extended to all classes of society, have given a
greater impetus to the trade and a far higher importance to the
art of upholstery than it has ever before attained.”</p>

<p>Research shows that in the early seventeenth century, at the
beginning of the Jacobean period, stools, chairs, settees and sofas
were upholstered. Both seats and backs were padded and covered
with leather or textiles. Sometimes, instead of tacking the goods
onto the furniture itself, loose cushions were made to fit the frame.
These cushions were called “squabs.” With the introduction of
leather in upholstering, comfort was not the primary thought, but
in common with all structures of the period, durability was a first
consideration. So the leather utilized was thick and stiff, thus
offering durability, but little comfort.</p>

<p>The Flanders chair shown in Fig. <a href="#image009a">1</a> is done in leather. It is
one of two side chairs from the seventeenth century. One has
a plain leather back; the other is tooled, illustrating a decorative
coat of arms. The leather in this chair is made thick and rigid by
the use of a stiff paper core, on both sides of which is glued a jute-like
fabric, and over this the leather. This makes a five ply composition
of almost everlasting wearing qualities, but very susceptible
to checking and cracking.</p>

<p>The arm chair shown in Fig. <a href="#image009b">2</a> is Italian, from the early seventeenth
century. It has carved finials. Webbing is used as a foundation
for the seat, over which a jute-like fabric is fastened. A canvas
fabric is placed over this. The stuffing is placed over this and covered
with leather, which is nailed to the structure with large, flat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
brass-headed nails. The edging is a fabric gimp with fringed edge.</p>

<p>The arm chair illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image010a">3</a> is Italian, from the sixteenth
century. It has carved finials but no turned work. The leather
back is tooled, and gilded with an elaborate design. The leather
seat has been blocked up from below to maintain the original
appearance, and the leather is not the same grade as used on the
back. Round headed nails, of two sizes, and the fringed gimp, complete
the ornamentation.</p>

<p>The chair shown in Fig. <a href="#image010b">4</a> is an English ladder-back side chair
from the seventeenth century. Here we have both comfort and
practicability combined. The seat is built up with webbing, canvas
and stuffing, and covered with a needlework tapestry. It is
finished with a fringed gimp with brass headed nails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Not only does upholstery add comfort to furniture, but it reflects
the conditions in the life of a people. Alice F. Schmall said
recently: “With the accession of James I to the throne of England
the style of dress changed to trunk hose and padded doublet, and
the carven forms of furniture gave place to upholstery. There is
a sense of dignity and refinement about a really fine chair; and
the modern upholstered chair, which Chippendale developed, shows
that our ancestors were fully alive to its advantages in the way
of comfort.”</p>

<p>Good modern upholstery is to a great extent a copy of the older
forms. Newer goods are utilized but old methods of application are
retained. The cheaper forms of upholstery are, however, entirely
modern. While formerly there existed no cheap upholstery, today
wire and band iron are used in place of webbing, and tufting is done
by machine.</p>

<span class="smcap fs90">Tools and Materials</span></h3>
</div>

<p>TOOLS.—The only tools needed in simple upholstery, besides
those in the average manual training shop, are a gimp hammer,
a webbing stretcher, a pair of scissors, a regulator and straight
and curved needles. In Fig. <a href="#image012">5</a>, from left to right are illustrated:
webbing stretcher, regulator, gimp hammer and a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>The webbing stretcher may be made by driving nails into a
formed piece of wood as shown, 3½ inches wide by 7 inches long.
Then cut or file off the heads and file each to a sharp point.</p>

<p>The regulator is a long wire sharpened at one end and used for
sticking thru the muslin cover to rearrange the stuffing, to
insure evenness. This tool may be made from a heavy wire bent
in the form of a ring at one end, and sharpened at the other. Scissors
8 inches or more in length are more convenient than smaller
ones.</p>

<p>Two needles are required, a straight double pointed one 12
inches long, and a curved single pointed one 6 inches long. Several
other kinds will facilitate work, however. A straight, double
pointed 6-inch needle is convenient for sewing springs to webbing
and triangular pointed needles are best adapted for sewing leather.</p>

<p>Skewers are upholstery pins, usually 3 or 3½ inches long. They
are pointed on one end and bent in a circle on the other. These
are used in doing welt-edged work, or wherever it is necessary to
hold goods temporarily while adjusting the work.</p>

<p>All these tools may be purchased from any firm dealing in upholstery
supplies.</p>


<p>MATERIALS.—Webbing is our first consideration in the matter
of materials. The two best kinds are L. M. C. and B. F. M. The
former has a closer weave and is of better quality than the latter.
It will withstand great strain before its elasticity gives out. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
is good policy to purchase the better grade inasmuch as it costs
but 30 cents more for a 72-yard piece. L. M. C. comes in two
widths, 3½ inch and 4½ inch, with the former width in more general
use. The 3½ inch variety may be purchased for about $1.65
per 72-yard roll.</p>

<p>Burlap is the best material to use over webbing and over springs.
It will not rip and tear as readily as most textiles and it is therefore
a preferred material. Burlap comes in three weights: light (8 oz.),
medium (10 oz.), and heavy (12 oz.). The medium weight is best
adapted for our work. This may be purchased for 9 cents a yard.
It is 40 inches wide. Used burlap may ordinarily be purchased at
local dry-goods stores for about 5 cents per pound. Even considering
waste, this is much cheaper and quite as good as new burlap
for the work intended.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image012" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image012.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 5</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Several kinds of material may be employed for stuffing. The
very best material available is curled horse hair. It is also the
most expensive, costing from 30 to 65 cents per pound depending
upon quality. The stuffing recommended for such work as ours is
tow. This may be purchased by the 100-pound bale at a cost of 2<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
cents per pound. There are three grades of tow: fine, medium and
coarse. The fine variety should be used, for the coarser kinds are
hard to manipulate and result in uneven surfaces after a period of
use. Even with the medium grade of tow it is necessary to use a
layer of wadding over it to prevent ridges showing thru the
cover. Other stuffing materials are moss, kapok, alva, and excelsior.
Cork shavings are generally used for boat cushions.</p>

<p>When cloth is desired between the stuffing and cover, unbleached
muslin should be used. In cheaper work this is eliminated. In
our work we will find it advantageous, for it gives to the seat the
proper shape, and permits better and smoother work on the final
covering. After the application of the muslin, if it is found that the
seat is not of the desired shape, more stuffing may be added or the
stuffing may be distributed by the regulator. Muslin 36 inches wide
may be obtained for 7 cents a yard from any local dry-goods store.</p>

<p>Wadding is a kind of stuffing arranged in sheets. It is used over
other stuffing. Its function is to give a smooth, even appearance
to the seat or cushion. Wadding is invariably used over curled
hair to prevent the ends of the hair from penetrating the cover.
It may be purchased in sheets 30 × 36 inches; the one pound quality
at 35 cents per dozen sheets.</p>

<p>It is generally desirable to place cloth under the seat to prevent
dust from falling to the floor from the seat, and to exclude moths
from the stuffing. Cambric is desirable for this purpose. It has a
finish which makes it dust-proof, but it tears easily and cannot
supplant the muslin used over stuffing. Cambric comes in a 24-inch
width and costs about 5½ cents per yard.</p>

<p>There are innumerable varieties of fabrics adapted for outside
coverings, and good taste and judgment must be used in selecting
proper kinds for certain jobs. It is obvious that office and library
furniture require coverings of a different quality and kind from
that of the living room; and dining room furniture from that of the
bedroom. A footstool may properly be given a covering of different
character from a chair seat. In the selection of figured goods great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
discretion is necessary. The figures on fabrics for a chair seat or
back should manifestly be smaller and more subdued than those for
a sofa or davenport. A sense of good design needs to be developed
here, for proper selection is essential, both as regards color, figure,
and adaptability to the particular structure, and its placement.</p>

<p>The first piece of tapestry woven in this country was completed
in 1893. It was for a chair seat. The second was a counterpart
of the first and is now in the Field Museum of Chicago.</p>

<p>Tapestry may be defined as printing in colored threads. The
most perfect work in tapestry is produced on vertical looms, but
one-third more work may be accomplished on horizontal looms in
the same length of time. A Gobelin workman on a vertical loom
produces on an average, one square yard of tapestry in 300 working
days. The art in this work is the graduation of shades. In the best
days of tapestry weaving, between 1450 and 1550, but twenty to sixty
shades were known, while today we have knowledge of over 14,000.</p>

<p>“Brocade” is the term applied to any material having a raised
pattern. Formerly the name referred to materials with embroidered
patterns upon colored fabrics. “Chintz” is the term applied to
cotton cloth printed with a floral or bird design. “Denim” is a
strong, twilled cotton fabric. “Gunny” is jute-cloth. “Burlap”
is a substitute for gunny cloth.</p>

<p>There are three classes of coverings in upholstery: genuine
leather, textiles, and leather substitutes. Leather substitutes, or
so-called artificial leather, is well adapted for beginners in upholstery,
and is inexpensive. It is manufactured in 50 and 54-inch
widths, and costs from 60 cents to $1.75 per yard. Trade names of
leather substitute are Marokene, Chase Leather, Hercules, Victor
Leather, Pantasote, Mole Skin, Mule Skin, etc. The better varieties
are very durable and very closely resemble leather. Genuine
leather costs from 16 to 36 cents per square foot in the whole hide
or full skin, and up to 75 cents per foot cut to size. Cloth or textiles
cost from $1.00 to $3.00 per yard in the general run of grades. They
may cost as high as $10.00 per yard. Tapestry may run into
prohibitive costs. Some of the best textiles are tapestries, brocades,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
velvets, plushes, satins and hair cloth; cheaper ones are velours,
chintz, reps, and denims.</p>

<p>Gimp is a narrow edging used for covering raw edges of the cover
and heads of common tacks which secure the cover. It comes in
rolls of 25 to 36 yards. Black imitation leather gimp costs 20
cents a roll of 25 yards, and brown or Spanish, 35 cents. Cloth
gimp costs from 2 to 3 cents a yard.</p>

<p>Three kinds of nails may be used in the work outlined: solid
leather, Perfection and Metalene. Metalene is perhaps the most
satisfactory. These come in the following numbers with attendant
sizes; No. 230—½-inch head; No. 240—⅜-inch head; No. 250—<span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>-inch
head; No. 260—<span class="xs"><sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>-inch head, and No. 270—¾-inch head.
No. 250 is used in our work. They cost 80 cents per thousand in
the plain, and 90 cents in Spanish effect.</p>

<p>Upholstery springs may be purchased from 3 to 16 inches in
height. They cost 6 cents a pound and weigh from 22 to 100 pounds
per gross. On this basis the cost of the large ones approximates 4
cents apiece. The 9-inch springs are most frequently used, and
their cost is a trifle over 2 cents apiece. It is better to purchase
springs longer than necessary than to obtain them too short, for
they may easily be tied down. They should be twice as long as
the width of the rails into which they are placed.</p>

<p>Spring twine is needed for tying the springs. No. 60 four-ply
Italian hemp serves this purpose very well. This can be purchased
for 27 cents a pound in one-pound balls.</p>

<p>Stitching twine is also needed for spring and stitched edge work.
For this purpose No. 252 elm flax stitching is used. This costs 30
cents per half-pound ball.</p>

<p>The prices quoted are wholesale. Retail prices vary so much
in different communities, and even in different places in the same
community that they cannot be given with any fair degree of
accuracy. The wholesale prices quoted will, however, give some
idea of the cost of materials to the workman. At present, however,
even wholesale prices are very unstable. All prices above are
pre-war prices.</p>

<span class="smcap fs90">Upholstering a Board Structure</span></h3>
</div>

<p>A LOW FOOTSTOOL.—This project is chosen for the first
work in upholstery for the reason that it involves the simplest
processes possible. Nailing a piece of leather or strips of leather
across a frame cannot be dignified by the term upholstery. Therefore,
such work is not to be considered under this head. The
structure, in addition to the simple upholstery processes involved,
requires but elementary bench work in wood in its construction.</p>

<p>After staining the stool take a small amount of tow, pull it out
thoroly with the hands until all uneven bunches are eliminated;
then spread it out evenly on the top of the stool as illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#image017">6</a>. Then place a piece of muslin over this, tacking it with
4-oz. tacks ¼ inch from the edges of the board. The muslin should
be folded over on itself at the edges, and stretched very taut.
Tack each side first, then work toward corners. This method of
tacking insures a smooth, taut surface, and should be followed
always. Use the regulator, Fig. <a href="#image018">7</a>, to even out any irregularities
and to force the tow well out toward the outer edges of the muslin.
Then lay a piece of wadding over this to make a smooth surface;
see Fig. <a href="#image018">7</a>. Next stretch a piece of Marokene leather of the color
desired over the previous layers and secure it with 2½-oz. tacks.
These should be placed about 2 inches apart, ¼ inch from the edges
of the stool, and surplus fabric trimmed to ⅛ inch from edges.
Finally, cut a piece of gimp and secure with Metalene nails as
shown in Fig. <a href="#image019">8</a>. Fold the gimp at the corners and splice at the last
corner. Place the nails equal distances apart on parallel edges.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Be sure that the leather, gimp and nails harmonize with each other
and these with the final color of the stool.</p>


<p>A CART.—The different processes for upholstering a cart, illustrated
in Fig. <a href="#image020">9</a>, are identical to those just described, with the
exception that a margin is left at the edges of the seat. The cart
suggests a very practical application of simple upholstery, either
in covering a wood seat or in replacing a worn upholstered seat.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image017" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image017.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 6</p></figcaption>
</figure>


<p>A LEG REST.—The processes of upholstering the leg rest shown
in Fig. <a href="#image021a">10</a> vary substantially from those already discussed. Here
is the first introduction to a hard edge. Reference to Fig. <a href="#image021a">10</a> will
show how this edge is made. Chamfer the upper arris of the seat
as wide as the tack head and drive the tacks in at right angles to
the chamfer. This method avoids splitting the corners. The near
side of the illustration shows a piece of burlap tacked with two-thirds
of its width overhanging. Use 4-oz. tacks for this purpose,
and tack in such a way that the heads of the tacks are <em>even with
the edge</em> of the seat.</p>

<p>After the burlap has been secured in this way insert a small roll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of tow or a strand or two of welt cord under the burlap at the edge
of the seat. The diameter of this roll may vary from ¼ to ½ inch
as desired. Bring the burlap over and around the firmly packed
tow or cord, and tack down extremely close to the roll, keeping the
roll round. Special effort should be made to keep the roll smooth
and even, for its form determines the final form. The rear side of
the illustration, Fig. <a href="#image021a">10</a>, shows the completed roll.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image018" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image018.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 7</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Strips of webbing may be employed in place of burlap. Webbing
is a closer woven fabric than burlap, and in consequence produces
a more even roll. And webbing cord is preferable to tow for it requires
less time to place and results in a smooth edging.</p>

<p>The strip of soft wood shown in the illustration is called an
upholstery block. Gimp and muslin are secured to this block.
Without these blocks, one at each end, the cover could not be
placed without much labor and resulting unsightly folds at the
corners.</p>

<p>After the corner strips are placed and the rolls formed, place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
sufficient tow on the seat to produce a slightly rounded top when
the tow is pressed down firmly with the hands. The tow must be
picked, that is, pulled out thoroly to make it even and fluffy.
Place over this a piece of muslin, tacking it temporarily at the
center of each side with several 2½-oz. tacks. These should be
only partly driven, a process called slip-tacking or loose-tacking.
Stretch it tightly, and bring the threads of the muslin in line with
the edges of the seat. Next pull out the tacks from one side and
re-stretch the muslin by stroking it several times with the left
hand, always holding it with the right. Do this on each side in
succession. An expert workman will hold the tacks in his mouth and
the hammer in the right hand during the whole process. After the
muslin has been placed use the regulator and re-distribute the tow
should any unevenness exist. This process is called regulating.</p>

<p>Next place the cover. Whether it be genuine leather, leather
substitute or textile fabric, proceed as with the muslin omitting
folding the edges. Stretch the cover tightly and tack with 2½-oz.
tacks. Place the tacks a small fraction of an inch from the lower
edge of the board so the trimming of the cover may be easily done.
Apply the gimp. This covers the raw edges of the materials and
tack heads. Start at the right-hand corner, fastening it with a
2½-oz. tack. Carry it across to the left-hand corner and fasten
with another tack. Fold it upon itself so as to form a definite crease
then twist it over and carry it up and along the soft wood strip
to the next corner. Repeat this process to the starting point; then
cut the gimp off flush with the bottom of the board and secure with
a tack. As the forty-five degree folds are made, the gimp nails
should also be driven in place. Fig. <a href="#image021b">11</a> shows the steps in
making the folds at the corners. Space distances equally and
place all gimp nails. A desirable distance is from 1½ to 2½
inches—depending on the cover material. A quick way to place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
these nails is to drive a nail in the middle of an edge, then one in
the half way points between this and each corner, and so on. This
process gives good eye training. Fig. <a href="#image022a">12</a> shows completed leg rest.</p>

<p>A FOOTSTOOL.—The upholstery operations on the stool
shown in Fig. <a href="#image022b">13</a> are very similar to those on the leg rest. The
rolls are formed identically but are placed on four sides. Special
care must be exercised to keep the corners firm and even, and in
line with other parts of the rolls. The cover needs folding at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
corners to make it smooth. The gimp runs continuously around
the edge without folds. This form of stool requires a greater amount
of upholstery material than the first form, and is not as pleasing in
structural design, but is a more comfortable structure.</p>

</figure>

<p>A CHAIR SEAT.—The typical upholstered seat is undoubtedly
that of the dining chair. The processes involved are very simple.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
A shallow rabbet should be run along the inside edges of the seat
frame, say about ⅛ inch deep and ¾ inch wide. This will permit
the gimp to run flush with the top of the seat frame when all work
is completed.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp33" id="image025" style="max-width: 28.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image025.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 16</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First decide on the number of lengths of webbing that will be
required for the given area. Then, using
the best of webbing, take one end and
tack with 10-oz. tacks. If hard wood
is used in the structure and it tends to
split, use smaller tacks, say 8-oz. or
6-oz. Stretch the strand of webbing
with the webbing stretcher, and tack as
illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image030b">23</a>.</p>

<p>When four tacks have been driven in
cut the webbing off 1 inch beyond the
row of tacks; fold over, and tack down
with three tacks placed between the
four previous ones. Folding the ends
over rather than under is better practice,
for the fold protects the webbing
at the points of greatest strain. Use as
many tacks as the wood will permit,
for many tacks distribute the strain
over all threads of the webbing. After
the lengths of webbing have been attached
from front to back weave lengths
thru these from side to side as shown
in Fig. <a href="#image024a">14</a>, and secure in the same manner. The illustration
shows the underside of the seat.</p>

<p>Next tack burlap over the webbing with 4-oz. tacks. Cut the
burlap slightly larger than the opening, including the rabbet, and
fold the edges over in tacking. Stretch the burlap slightly to prevent
sagging in the opening, but not so tight that the webbing will
not support practically all the weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 18</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now place the stuffing, tow, picking it and working it into shape.
Over this secure muslin and then lay a sheet or two of blue-sheet
wadding over all. Place the leather substitute, and the gimp and
nails. The gimp is nailed against the rabbet edge, Fig. <a href="#image024b">15</a>. These
processes have been described and need no repetition here. The
finished seat frame is shown on a dining chair in Fig. <a href="#image025">16</a>. The
back of the chair is also upholstered, practically in a manner identical
to the seat. On the rear of this back a piece of leather substitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
of same color and finish as the front is tacked and the edges
covered with gimp. It is a good practice to tack a piece of cambric
under the seat frame for sanitary reasons indicated in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p>A SET-IN SEAT.—This form of seat is very convenient for any
chair or stool where a set-in
seat is desired. Cleats on
which the seat rests may be
screwed or nailed to the rails,
or the rails may be rabbetted
to receive them. Corner
blocks may also be utilized
for the purpose. In addition
the seat may be fastened to
these rests with screws. This
usually prevents the chair
from squeaking, due to a
loose seat.</p>

<p>In constructing the wood
frame for this kind of seat
allow at least <span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch for
the thickness of materials.
More allowance should be
made for thick material and
genuine leather.</p>

<p>Attach webbing and burlap in the usual manner; then form the
hard edge as described previously. The hard edge is shown in
Fig. <a href="#image026a">17</a> together with tow, wadding, and muslin, and Fig. <a href="#image026b">18</a> shows
the seat ready for the covering after the trimming of the raw edges.
The finished seat placed in a rocker is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image027">19</a>.</p>

<p>FOOTSTOOL.—A stool which makes a very interesting problem
for simple upholstery is shown in Fig. <a href="#image028">20</a>. This is typical of that
class of structures on which the coverings completely hide the
rails, leaving only the legs exposed. The rails should be placed ⅜
inch below the rounded part of the legs, and be at least ⅞ inch
thick. Inside arrises of the rails should be rounded with a rasp to
prevent the webbing from eventually being cut thru. The framework
of such a structure is shown in Fig. <a href="#image029">21</a>. Attach the
corner blocks as shown in Fig. <a href="#image030a">22</a>; then properly stretch the webbing
and tack it in place. The webbing is the ground work of upholstering,
and the durability of the work depends to a considerable
degree upon its quality and proper application. Use the original
roll of webbing. This enables the worker to use the webbing
stretcher without waste. Both ends should be used. This permits
the utilization of the two free ends, and allows freer work. Fig. <a href="#image030b">23</a>
illustrates the method of using the webbing stretcher.</p>

<p>PROCEDURE.—Fold the end of the webbing over about 1 inch
and tack with five 10-oz. tacks as near the middle of the rail as
possible. This is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image031">24</a>. The ends of the webbing
should be folded over and not under, as suggested before. The tacks
will hold better. The middle length of webbing should be placed
first to facilitate equal spacing between strands. The other free
end of the bolt of webbing should be tacked on the opposite side
in like manner to assure proper spacing. Fig. <a href="#image031">24</a> shows the ends
tacked and stretched from the same side, but in tacking them from
the opposite sides it tends to prevent splitting, for the last ends
are to be secured with seven tacks. After the first end is secured
with five tacks use the webbing stretcher and pull the webbing
across, extremely taut, and fasten with four tacks while thus
stretched. Do likewise with the second strand. Cut each piece
about an inch from the tacks; then fold over and tack with three
tacks. Before tacking the two long strands they should be woven
thru the shorter strands as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image031">24</a>. The openings
between strands should not exceed 2 inches.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Cover the webbing with burlap. The
edges of this should project slightly beyond
the ends of the webbing, as illustrated
in Fig. <a href="#image032">25</a>.</p>

<p>It is desirable, in fact essential, in
all upholstery to keep the cover away
from the wood as much as possible.
This prevents the cover from becoming
worn or cut, and avoids a hard, uncomfortable
edge for the occupant of the
upholstered structure.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>A simple expedient to avoid this contact with wood is to attach
a hard edge all around the top of the rail. This edge is made by
tacking strips of burlap on in such a manner that tow may
be rolled in them. They are then retacked behind the roll. The
first row of tacks should be placed so that the heads run flush
with the outer edge of the rail. The strip of burlap on the farther
side of the stool shown in Fig. <a href="#image033a">26</a> is fastened in this way. The roll
on the near side is complete. On the left end the burlap is shown
partly rolled back to reveal the tow in place. The tow must be
thoroly worked in with the finger to produce an even, smooth edge,
and the burlap drawn tight to make it firm.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image031.jpg" alt="">

</figure>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image033b">27</a> shows all four rolls in place ready for the corner or upholstery
blocks, providing the first form of corner blocks illustrated
in Fig. <a href="#image030a">22</a> have not been attached. The first form of block is preferred
by most workmen. In Fig. <a href="#image033a">26</a> is shown the second form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
corner block in place. This is fitted behind the rolls, and is cut
in a manner to avoid short grain, which has a tendency to split.
Corner blocks are required when gimp is run continuous around the
edge of the cover. These are secured with several brads, against
both posts and rails. Take tow and pick it over thoroly; then place
it upon the stool making a rounded heap from the top edges of
the rolls. Pack and work into place very thoroly to secure an
even seat. The hands easily detect uneven areas, and may be
more readily depended upon than the eyes.</p>

<p>Now stretch and tack the muslin in place. Fig. <a href="#image034">28</a> shows the
processes completed. Slip-tack it in the centers of four sides with
two or three tacks to a side. Slit the muslin diagonally from the
corners to a point immediately inside the legs. Fold the edges
under; work from the center toward the corners, and tack the muslin
permanently. Keep the muslin smooth and drawn tightly.</p>

<br>

<p>The covering is placed practically in the same manner as the
muslin. Great care must be exercised to avoid cutting too far at
the corners, to have the material fit snugly, and to have the whole
job firm and smooth. If, after the gimp has been placed, portions
of the covering show below, these may be trimmed easily with a
sharp knife or chisel.</p>

<p>ORDER OF PROCEDURE.—The following order of processes
in upholstering may be considered standard:</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">

<li>&#x2007;1. Rasp inside arrises of rails.</li>
<li>&#x2007;2. Apply webbing.</li>
<li>&#x2007;3. Fasten burlap.</li>
<li>&#x2007;4. Secure rolls on top edges.</li>
<li>&#x2007;5. Fasten corner blocks.</li>
<li>&#x2007;6. Pack with tow.</li>
<li>&#x2007;7. Place muslin.</li>
<li>&#x2007;8. Place the covering.</li>
<li>&#x2007;9. Tack gimp in place.</li>
<li>10. Place nails.</li>

</ul>


<p>DIFFERENT METHODS.—This type of footstool may be
treated in a variety of ways. Webbing may be omitted as a
base for the upholstery and a board substituted, preferably
some thin stock. Instead of bringing the cover down to the
lower edge of the rails as in Fig. <a href="#image028">20</a>, a shallow rabbet may
be run and the upholstery brought to the edge of this as
shown in Fig. <a href="#image036">31</a>. Or it may be treated in the manner shown
on the footstool illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image035b">30</a>. In this instance it
would be similar to a pad seat. The rails of the stool should here
be placed even with the chamfer on the legs. The stool may also
be upholstered with a welt edge. This method is very desirable
when the worker is limited to small pieces of tapestry or leather.
Welt-edged work will be described in a chapter on spring-edge
work.</p>

<span class="smcap fs90">Making a Hard-edge Seat</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The hard-edge seat as it is technically termed is relatively simple
when compared with other kinds of upholstering, but it is probably
the most important of the group. The edge of the seat needs to be
stuffed and sewed in a manner that makes it hard and firm, while
the center is springy. With a working knowledge of this class of
upholstery one may make some of the finest pieces of furniture
without difficulty. The directions to be given may be modified to
suit any particular piece of work in this group.</p>


<p>METHOD.—Construct a frame 18 × 24 inches outside dimensions,
and 3 inches deep. Employ a simple butt joint, secured with
nails and reinforced with corner blocks as shown in Fig. <a href="#image039">32</a>. A
light, close-grained wood, as poplar, basswood or pine is preferred
to hard, open-grained wood.</p>

<p>The webbing is fastened in place as described in Chapter V, using
but three strands crosswise and two the lengthwise of the frame.
This is a different type of work, and the suggestions as to spacing
do not apply here as in the footstool just described. The webbing
is placed so that the springs, six in number, stand over the laps.
A distance of about 3 inches should be left between the outer edge
of the frame and the springs. The webbing is 3½ inches wide, and
the No. 3 springs used are 5 inches across. These dimensions determine
that the strands of webbing should be 3¾ inches from the
outer edge of the frame.</p>

<p>Place springs in position turning the bent ends up. Sew these
to the webbing with stitching twine using a 6 or 12 inch double-pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
needle. Make at least three loops around the bottom coil,
fastening it securely to the webbing. Pull the twine taut and tie
the final end to a nearby stitch. Fig. <a href="#fig33">33</a> illustrates the method
of sewing.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image039" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image039.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 32</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Next the springs are tied with spring twine to keep them in an
upright position, and to prevent breaking down and bending.
The twine also supports the burlap and stuffing above it. After
the springs are tied down the twine should receive all the pull from
the reaction. Upon the permanency of the webbing and spring
twine depend the lasting qualities of the seat. The twine generally
deteriorates or breaks first, and then the webbing. To insure a
relatively permanent seat tie the springs eight times, that is, place
four strands across each spring, one from front to back, one from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
side to side, and two diagonals. Multiply the dimension of the
frame by one and two-thirds to determine the lengths of twine
required.</p><br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 34</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>THE PROCESS.—Tie a simple knot in one end of a length of
twine. Drive a 10-oz. tack thru this into the top edge of the frame
and in line with the centre of the spring. Then stretch the twine
across the top of the springs to the opposite side of the frame; pull
the springs down with it until the outer side of the coil is about
6 inches from the bottom and the inner side about 7 inches. Adjust
the springs to stand vertical. Grasp the twine and spring
nearest the fastened end with the thumb and forefinger of the
left hand; hold them, while with the right hand pass the free end
of the twine down inside the coil, up on the left hand side of the
fastened end, down inside the coil again, up on the right hand side
of the fastened end, and thru loop thus formed. Pull it tight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
This is called a clove hitch knot. Its advantage is that it does not
loosen even after the twine over the top of the wire wears off.
With the easier knot the entire twine loosens immediately after
the top wears. A careful examination of Fig. <a href="#image041">34</a>, and a little
practice will clarify the method just described. Pull the twine taut
to the other side of the coil and form another knot. This time,
however, the twine is passed down on the outside of the coil first
and up on the inside. Before tying the second spring space it at
the top a distance equal to that at the bottom. When the second end
is to be tied, drive a tack part way into the edge of the frame and wind
the twine once and a quarter around it, pull it tight enough to
bring the springs down properly, and drive tack securely. Drive
a second tack close to the one at the end. The twine should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
fastened in just this way so that in moving up and down with the
springs it will not wear away against the head of the tack.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image042" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image042.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 35</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>All other twines are fastened and tied in practically the same
manner. However, care must be exercised that the springs are
not drawn down lower with successive strands of twine, or an uneven
strain and wear will result. The last twine should be tied
to all others crossing at the spring centers, to prevent twine wearing
at these points. A study of Fig. <a href="#image041">34</a> should make clear any doubtful
point.</p>

<p>Tack a piece of 10 or 12-oz. burlap on the top edge of the frame
with 4-oz. tacks, folding the edges over as they are being tacked.
Fasten it just tight enough to insure smoothness, avoiding pulling
the springs down lower. As previously stated all spring reaction
strain should fall on the twine exclusively. Sew the burlap to the
springs with a curved needle and stitching twine. This keeps the
burlap in position, prevents wearing, and helps to unify the seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Place the stuffing. Work over about 5 pounds of tow, and work
it down and out over the seat until it extends about 3 inches beyond
the frame as shown to the left of Fig. <a href="#image042">35</a>. Be careful to keep the
tow even at all times, especially at the edges.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image043" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image043.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 36</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Place a piece of light burlap, 6 or 8-oz. weight over the tow. It
should be large enough to be slip-tacked on the sides of the frame.
Stitch thru the two layers of burlap and the tow with a 12-inch
double-pointed needle. The row of stitching should come just
outside the edge of the springs. Each stitch should be about 3
inches long, and it is formed by passing the needle up and down
thru the burlap. After all four sides have been stitched pull the
twine tight. Begin at the first stitch and pull each taut in succession.
Finally take a few stitches thru the center of the seat at
irregular intervals, thus making the seat firm and compact. Do
not stitch around the loose coils of the springs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image044a" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Now release the slip tacking and roll the loose edges of the burlap
under the tow. Drive tacks thru that part of the burlap which
comes in contact with the top edge of the frame, beginning at
the center of each of the four sides and working toward the corners.
Use precaution to make all sides equal. Tack the corners last.
Should they be too full, due to the overlapping of the burlap, cut
away some burlap and remove the necessary amount of tow to keep
the corner even with the sides.</p>

<p>We now arrive at that process in the development of the seat
from which this class of upholstery derives its name. The stitching
of the rolled edge already formed is rather difficult, and care must
be exercised to assure a neat appearing seat. Stitch the edge around
to the number of two or three rows. Use a 6-inch curved needle,
and beginning at the left-hand end of one of the rolls, start the
needle about 1½ inches from the row of tacks, and allow it to emerge
about 1½ inches from the row of stitching. About 1½ inches to the
right insert the needle into the roll again about ¾ inch from the row
of stitching, and allow it to emerge about ¾ inch from the row of
tacks. Tie the end of the twine around the other with a double slip
knot. Insert the needle again about 1½ inches to the right, up thru
the roll, and down as before. Repeat this operation around the four
sides of the seat, regulating as the stitching progresses. The right-hand
needle in Fig. <a href="#image043">36</a> shows the first row of stitching. Always
insert the needle at a right angle to the roll, for the arc of the needle
gathers in considerable tow which is forced into the roll as the
twine is pulled taut.</p>

<p>The second row of stitching is also illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image043">36</a>. The
stitches in this operation are not made in a zig-zag manner as in
the first row. The needle is inserted about ½ inch above the first
row of stitching and allowed to emerge at the same distance on top.
Work to the left at an interval of ¾ inch and use the double slip knot
as previously. Pass the needle to the right about 2½ inches and
insert it as at first, then carry it back again about ¾ inch and push
it thru the roll allowing the end to project; then loop the twine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
around the point. See left-hand needle in Fig. <a href="#image043">36</a>. Repeat on all four
sides. After the second row of stitching is completed a third row of
stitching may be made. Then place more stuffing on the top of the
seat, rounding out all irregularities. This is called double stuffing,
and work of this kind is termed double stuffed work. Hair is
extremely resilient, and used for this purpose adds life to the seat.
Moss will answer the purpose. Place a layer of cotton batting
over this. Then a piece of muslin is finally tacked over all.
Fig. <a href="#image044a">37</a> shows the muslin partly tacked, and the two layers of
material rolled back. Keep the muslin smooth, especially at
the corners, cutting away all surplus material.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image046" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image046.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">FIG. 39</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Use a cover of soft material rather than one of leather or substitutes.
Secure it in place like the muslin, only tack it under
the lower edges of the frame and fold it carefully at the corners as
illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image044b">38</a>. The process of blind stitching is plainly
shown. When the seat has been covered tack a piece of cambric
underneath. The hard-edge seat is then finished. Fig. <a href="#image046">39</a> shows
the completed cricket.</p>

<p>A QUEEN ANNE STOOL.—This stool also has a hard-edge
seat but the method followed is a modification of the one just
described. In the former the upholstered seat was built over a box
or frame, and fitted snugly into the cricket base. In this project
the upholstery is fastened permanently to the rails; it becomes an
integral part of the structure. The edge is blind stitched. The
webbing cannot be tacked directly to the rails; they are too weak
to withstand the strain, and in this instance are curved or formed,
which precludes tacking webbing underneath. In such instances
the webbing is folded several times and tacked thru the folds
against the inner sides of the rail. If the rails are not sufficiently
strong strips may be screwed on as reinforcement. This has been
done in this instance as shown in Fig. <a href="#image048">42</a>. Frequently on such
structures a brace or two is placed across between the long rails.</p>

<p>The identical method of upholstering is followed from this
point on as in the cricket, up to the point of stuffing. This seat
is shallow requiring considerably less tow. Place just a sufficient
amount to prevent the springs from being felt under pressure from
the hand; then place and secure the burlap in the usual manner.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Next sew the hard edge with a 12-inch straight double-pointed
needle. Begin about ¾ inch above the rail, and permit the needle
to emerge above about 4 inches from the edge. The left-hand
needle in Fig. <a href="#image049a">43</a> shows the method. Pull the needle up to its eye
as shown in the middle needle; then bend the point toward the
lower edge. As it emerges toward the right loop the twine around
the needle and pull it thru. This brings the twine around the tow,
pulls it down firmly toward the lower edge and holds it there. This
operation is frequently called blind hard-edge stitching. The
<a href="#image006">Frontispiece</a> shows the finished stool, and Fig. <a href="#image049b">44</a> another stool
employing the same form of seat.</p>

<p>The first evidence of deterioration in much old spring upholstered
furniture is a sagging seat. If attended to at the first indication of
sag the fault may be remedied by simply retacking the webbing
which most likely has pulled
away from the rails. If the sag is
not remedied shortly the stuffing
begins to shift, and the exposed
springs will soon cut or wear a
hole thru the cover. Then the
seat is practically beyond repair,
with the exception of the utilization
of the springs. Should the
springs show evidence of rust, or
if they have lost their temper and
resiliency, new ones are required.
The best policy is to repair a seat
at the first indications of sag,
providing the materials generally are worthy of repair.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#image050">45</a> is shown a small rocker with webbing and springs
placed, and springs properly tied. This seat is a reconstruction
job. Note that the cords are secured inside the rails, and that the
webbing is tacked underneath the rails excepting on the front rail
where it is fastened inside. This is necessary because of the curve
on the bottom of the front rail. It shows the base for a hard-edge
seat, and is treated in the same manner as the Queen Anne stool
previously described. The one exception is that the goods are to
be stretched over the faces of the rails and tacked underneath.</p>


<p>OLD FURNITURE.—Many heirlooms and other pieces of
old furniture may be repaired by reglueing and replacing parts, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
by re-upholstering, and the whole refinished so that it will compare
favorably with fine pieces of furniture. A piece of furniture of this
kind is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image051a">46</a>. The treatment of the seat is somewhat
different from that described before. The front edge has a hard
edge, identical to that described in Chapter VI. The edges at
the sides and back need no sewing; at least, they require very little
stitching.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>The webbing is tacked on the inner edges of the back, otherwise
the rabbet would prove too shallow to permit the gimp to
run flush with the wood surface. The stuffing should be stitched
to the burlap and webbing. This holds all firmly together.</p>

<p>To upholster the arms tack twine over the edges, forming loose
loops into which stuffing may be placed. This twine holds the
stuffing in place while the muslin is being tacked and the proper
shape or form given to the arms. Then place the cover over this,
carefully folding and drawing at the corners. Tack firmly in
place and attach the gimp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image051b">47</a> illustrates an overstuffed chair. The processes described
for making a hard-edge seat are followed on a chair of this kind.
It requires patience to upholster, but when covered with a good
piece of tapestry results in a very valuable and comfortable piece
of furniture.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#image052">48</a> is illustrated a rocker which shows examples of both
loose and attached pads on a single structure. The seat is a hard-edge
loose pad, made in a manner identical to the cricket, but with
a curved front which increases the difficulty of the work. The arms
are loose pads held by means of dowels. The back pad is fastened
to the frame by means of screws, secured before the back part of
the cover is attached. With substantial upholstery work this type
of chair is both serviceable and comfortable.</p>

<span class="smcap fs90">Spring-edge Upholstery</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The two examples of furniture illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image054">49</a> are two
types which are upholstered in a very different manner from any
of the processes described thus far. This is spring-edge work, and
is very generally employed on sofas, lounges and settees. In upholstery
of this kind the springs must be placed flush with the outside
of the frame. This necessitates bending the springs out somewhat.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image055a">50</a> shows a chair of this type with webbing attached and
the method of stitching the springs to the webbing. Note the
spacing of the webbing. Fig. <a href="#image055b">51</a> shows a top view of the same seat.
Notice that the springs are flush with the outside surface of the
rail. The spring wire is shown attached and formed. This form
must be accurately made for it determines the final outline of the
seat. The wire is fastened near the ends to the upholstery blocks,
with staples, and to the springs by means of stitching twine coiled
and tied. There is on the market a certain metal clip for fastening
the coil and wire together. These clips are attached by means of
a pair of special pliers.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image056a">52</a> shows the seat in a natural view. Note the method of
tying the springs. This is different from the method previously
described. The twine is brought down inside of a spring and tied
to a second or third coil instead of over the outside top coil. This
permits the top coil to lie horizontal, and braces the spring so it
remains vertical. Fig. <a href="#image055b">51</a> also illustrates this method. A twine is
also tacked to the top of the frame and carried up to the spring wire
and down to the frame again. It is clearly shown in Fig. <a href="#image056a">52</a>. This
twine braces the springs and prevents sagging, and results in
a vertical motion rather than partially horizontal when the seat
is used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Over this spring work a piece of burlap is then placed and tacked
with 4-oz. tacks on the top edge of the frame, as illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#image056b">53</a>. This burlap must fit tight enough to be smooth, but care
must be exercised that it does not fit so tight as to result in the pulling
down of the springs. Next place a layer of tow over the burlap.
Follow with another piece of burlap, and sew onto the spring wire
instead of tacking to the frame as in a hard-edge seat. Next form
the hard edge, and finish off with tow or moss as described previously.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image057">54</a> shows the various steps in the building up of a seat.
After the tow has been placed lay on a piece of blue sheet wadding
or a layer of cotton batting. Lay the cover over this and tack it
loosely upon the frame and upholstery blocks at the back; stretch
toward the front and fasten underneath the spring wire with skewers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and secure it in a similar manner at the sides. Then adjust it
carefully; tack permanently at the back, and then sew just under
the spring wire. These stitches may be seen at the left in Fig. <a href="#image057">54</a>.</p>

<p>The next step is the placing of the welt edge. This edge is
clearly shown in Fig. <a href="#image058a">55</a>. Just below the turn of the top piece a
beading may be seen. This is the welt edge, and immediately below
is the band. In Fig. <a href="#image057">54</a> is shown a close view of the welt edge. The
process of making it is as follows: Fold a narrow strip of cloth
around a soft cord. Hold it against the seat with the edges down;
turn the band inside out and sew its lower edge. Run the curved
needle thru it and the welting so that the seam comes immediately
above the seam which fastens the top cover to the seat. Sew from
right to left, for then the piece may be handled conveniently with
the left hand while sewing is done with the right. Three pieces
are manipulated in this work; the cord, the narrow band of cloth
folded around the cord, and the front band. This process may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
simplified if a sewing machine is employed. Then the welting cord
may be sewed into the top edge of the front band. When this is
sewed to the chair seat but one piece remains to be managed.</p>

<p>The front band should be draped or folded at the corners. This
fold may be noticed at the corners of the chair seat in Fig. <a href="#image058a">55</a>, and
it allows the band to run about the corner full and smooth. This
is all the more necessary because some stuffing is placed behind the
band to keep the band from falling in when the edge of the seat
is pressed down.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp46" id="image058a" style="max-width: 51em;">

<p>In Fig. <a href="#image058b">56</a> is shown the gimp. It is generally fastened with
gimp tacks, but in very fine work it is glued in place. Glueing has
a distinct advantage where the gimp must be placed around curves
for then it may run continuously rather than in a series of straight
lines between tacks, as is necessary when tacks are employed.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#image059a">57</a> are shown a series of problems in upholstery; in Fig.
<a href="#image059b">58</a>, the application of such type problems to structures of a distinctly
useful nature.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;

work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
